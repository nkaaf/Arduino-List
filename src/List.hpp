 *
 * This is the documentation for the List Library for the Arduino platform.
 * Because of the independence of Arduino libraries, it could be theoretically
 * used for every C/C++ program.
 * It extends the arduino ecosystem with easy-to-use list implementations. They
 * are specially designed and optimized for different purposes.

 * provide a simple and well implemented basic structure for building great
 * software.
